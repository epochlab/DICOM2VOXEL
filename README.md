#### Visualizing DICOM datasets.
Abstract: *Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is the standard for the communication and management of medical imaging information and related data. This repository allows a user to view DICOM data plus render the dataset as 3D voxel grid in SideFX Houdini.*

### Packages

`pydicom` `numpy` `matplotlib`

### Dataset
